# mirror-just

OCX mirror for [just](https://just.systems), a handy command runner. One
repository, one spec directory per package.

| Package | Spec | Publishes to | Announced as | Upstream SPDX |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [just](https://github.com/casey/just) | [`just/mirror.yml`](just/mirror.yml) | `ghcr.io/ocx-contrib/just/just` | `ocx.sh/just/just` | `CC0-1.0` |

Each upstream release is discovered, re-bundled, smoke-tested per
`(version, platform)` and only then pushed with cascade tags, after which the
result is announced into the OCX index.

> This repository previously published the same upstream to the flat coordinate
> `ocx.sh/just`. `just/just` is the grouped successor — `casey` is a personal
> handle rather than a vendor, so the tool names itself.

## Layout

```
mirror-base.yml         repo-wide policy every spec inherits via `extends:`
just/
├── mirror.yml          the spec — never at the repo root
├── metadata.json       bundle interface
├── CATALOG.md          → ocx package describe
├── logo.svg / logo.png describe assets, 512px PNG
└── tests/smoke.star    Starlark smoke test
```

`LICENSE` and `NOTICE.md` are shared at the root. Logos are **not** — each
package carries its own, because a repo-root `logo.*` sits in no workflow's
`paths:` filter, so replacing it would publish nothing until some unrelated
edit happened to fire.

⚠️ `extends:` is a **shallow** merge of top-level keys. A spec that restates
`platforms:` to change one runner drops every `containers:` entry with it, and
nothing reds — the legs simply stop existing, and every `os.features` claim
goes back to being asserted rather than verified. Restate a block in full or
not at all.

## Platforms

`just` publishes six platform entries: both Linux arches, both macOS arches and
both Windows arches. Upstream ships **only** `*-unknown-linux-musl` assets for
Linux — no `-gnu` build exists — but a musl target *triple* is not a musl
*requirement*. Both Linux binaries were byte-measured on 1.57.0 and are fully
**static**: no `PT_INTERP`, no `DT_NEEDED`, musl linked *in* rather than linked
*against*. `os.features` states what an artifact requires *of the host*, so
both Linux keys are **bare**: tagging them `+libc.musl` would be a false
requirement that hid the package from every glibc host it in fact runs on. The
`alpine:3.20` container leg in `mirror-base.yml` is what turns that claim into
evidence; the measurement itself is recorded above the `assets:` block in
`just/mirror.yml`.

## Editing

| File | Edit | Regenerate after |
|------|------|------------------|
| `mirror-base.yml`, `just/mirror.yml` | hand | yes — see below |
| `just/{metadata.json,CATALOG.md,logo.*}` | hand | — |
| `just/tests/smoke.star` | hand | — |
| `.github/workflows/*.yml` | **generated — never hand-edit** | re-run when a spec changes |

```bash
ocx-mirror package pipeline generate ci --spec just/mirror.yml
```

**Name every spec.** `--spec` *appends* rather than replaces, so a command
naming a subset silently stops rendering the rest while staying green — and the
drift guard reds on a generated workflow the current spec set no longer
produces.

`verify-generated.yml` exits 65 on drift. If a generated workflow is wrong, the
spec or the renderer template is wrong — fix it there and regenerate.

Run `direnv allow` once to put the pinned toolchain on `PATH`, and invoke
`ocx-mirror` directly — never `ocx run -- ocx-mirror`, which pins
`OCX_BINARY_PIN` to the bootstrap `ocx` and false-reds the nested push.

## The binaries claim

`just/metadata.json` declares `binaries: ["just"]` by hand, and
`just/mirror.yml` sets `bin_scan: "off"` — forced, not preferred. The scan only
inspects an interface-visible `${installPath}/<dir>` PATH entry, and just's
archives are **flat**: `just(.exe)`, the man page, `GRAMMAR.md`, `README.md` and
`completions/` all sit at the archive root with no subdirectory to point one at.
With nothing to inspect the scan would pass green whatever the archive
contained, so `auto` and `verify` both fail spec load at exit 65 rather than
offer a hollow check. The hand-written list is what the error message itself
directs, and it is short and stable — `just` is the only mode-0755 entry; the
rest is 0644 data.

## Required secrets

| Secret | Use |

| `OCX_ANNOUNCE_TOKEN` | opens the index pull request from the `ocx-contrib/index` fork |
| `OCX_MIRROR_DISCORD_HOOK` | notify-stage Discord webhook URL |

(Inherited from the `ocx-contrib` org with visibility ALL. GHCR pushes use the
run's own `GITHUB_TOKEN` — no registry secret needed.)
